# Segregation-and-Prediction-of-Salary-Values-Using-Machine-Learning

This project I have developed using Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The development process involved several key steps including data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. The data for this project was sourced from data.world, a comprehensive repository of diverse datasets, comprising variables such as Employer's Name, Job Categories, Salary of Employees, and Country Name, Job Title, Total Experience Years, Employers Experience Years etc. For the supervised learning aspect, a Decision Tree classifier will be implemented to predict high earning potential based on features like Employer's Name, Job Category, and Country. In addition, K-Means clustering will be employed as the unsupervised learning technique to identify clusters within the dataset based on the relationship between Job Categories and Salary of Employees, providing valuable insights into salary trends across different job roles. Overall, this project aims to bridge the gap between job categories and salary trends through advanced machine learning analysis, offering actionable insights for informed decision-making in the job market.
